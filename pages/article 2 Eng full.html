&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earliest of times, sailors have found ways to  
<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>navigate</strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover"> navigate  (verb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ˋnævə͵get ]<br/><br/>
(to direct the way that a ship, aircraft, etc. will travel, or to find a direction) <br/><br/>

their ships on the seas and oceans of the world. The earliest sailors navigated by simply following the coastline. Aside from being a rather slow method 
of navigating, this method was also rather dangerous and limited. It was dangerous in that waters close to the shoreline could be shallow enough to strand 
a ship or the waters could be full of rocky <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>protrusions</strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">protrusion  (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [proˋtruʒən]<br/><br/>
(something that sticks out from a surface)<br/><br/><em>The dinosaur has a series of protrusions along its back.</em></span></span></a>

capable of sending ships to their graves. When seafarers began sailing out of sight of land more than 4,000 years ago, they used the stars to determine 
their direction. They calculated the distance traveled from their speed and sailing time, and they drew rough charts and maps to find their way and to 
exchange information about navigational routes with others. It had also been known as early as 300 B.C. that a <a class="hideDisplay">
<font color="blue"><ins><strong>sundial</strong></ins></font><span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
 sundial  (noun) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ˋsʌn͵daɪəl] <br/><br/>

<em>People used sundials to tell times in ancient times.</em></span></span></a>

casts a longer shadow as it is moved farther north of the equator
, and this information was used by sailors from that time to get an idea of how far north
 of the <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>equator </strong></ins></font><span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">equator  (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [ɪˋkwetɚ]<br/><br/>

 a ship was. All of these methods provided only very <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>rudimentary </strong></ins></font>

means of navigating. 
<br/>
<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until more than 3,000 years after sailors set out on 
the seas that the compass was developed. The <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>premise </strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">premise   (noun )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [ˋprɛmɪs]<br/><br/>

 of a compass is that the<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> magnetized  </strong></ins></font>

needle of a compass, when<strong> <u>it</u></strong> is balanced on a central<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> pivot </strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">pivot   (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [ˋpɪvət]<br/><br/>

or left to float on liquid, will always turn to point in the direction of magnetic north. Navigators on Chinese ships were the first
 ones who were known to use compasses to determine the direction their ships were heading, as early as 1100. 
<br/>
<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous inventions were created to determine a ship's 
<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>latitude</strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">latitude    (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [ˋlætə͵tjud]<br/><br/>
(the latitude of a place is its distance from the equator)<br/><br/><em>
Toronto shares the same latitude as Nice. </em></span></span></a>. 

With the invention of the <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong>astrolabe</strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">astrolabe   (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [ˋæstrə͵leb]<br/><br/>
(a circular device used for measuring the position of stars, and on ships for calculating the ship's position)<br/><br/><em>
Some scholars believe that this astrolabe was created by the prince.</em></span></span></a>. 


 in the fourteenth century, sailors were able to measure the Sun's height with better accuracy than with a sundial, and they were 
 able to use the information provided by the astrolabe to determine how far north of the equator they were. An astrolabe was a 
 metal circle with a sighting rule that<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> rotated</strong></ins></font>
 <span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">rotate   (verb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     [ˋrotet]<br/><br/>
(to turn or cause something to turn in a circle)<br/><br/><em>
The wheel continued to rotate.</em></span></span></a>

 in the circle; the <u><strong>rule</strong></u> could be<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> aligned </strong></ins></font>
  <span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">align    (verb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     [əˋlaɪn]<br/><br/>
(to put two or more things into a straight line)<br/><br/><em>
Align the ruler with the edge of the paper.</em></span></span></a>


with the Sun, and measurements on the ring indicated the Sun's height. Other devices followed that were better able to determine the Sun's height 
and thus provide an idea of the ship's latitude. The backstaff, invented in 1595, and the
<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> sextant </strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">sextant    (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [ˋsɛkstənt]<br/><br/>
(a device used on a ship or aircraft for measuring angles)<br/><br/><em>
There are many sextants in the space museum.</em></span></span></a>

, invented in 1757, were devices that each improved a navigator's ability to determine latitude. The backstaff was a device that required the navigator 
to face away from the Sun and make a calculation of the shadow in relation to the horizon. The sextant was a measuring device that required the navigator 
to look into an eyepiece and calculate the Sun's position relative to the horizon and then check printed tables to convert this information into latitude. 
<br/>
<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The missing piece in the navigational puzzle </strong>was the ability 
to calculate<a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins><strong> longitude</strong></ins></font>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">longitude   (noun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ˋlɑndʒəˋtjud]<br/><br/>
(the distance of a place east or west of an imaginary line between the North Pole and the South Pole, measured in degrees)<br/><br/><em>
The line of zero degree longitude passes through Greenwich.</em></span></span></a>

, or how far east or west a ship had traveled. The need for a device to calculate longitude was so important to navigators that the 
English Parliament offered a reward of 20,000 pounds (an extraordinarily large sum at the time, perhaps $10 million in today's currency)
 to anyone who could invent a method for calculating longitude. In 1759, English clockmaker John Harrison built a chronometer that was 
 accurate enough for navigation. <strong>The premise of the device was that the Sun rises two seconds later each day for each kilometer traveled
  in a westerly direction, so the accurately measured change in time was an accurate way to calculate longitude.</strong> Harrison was easily
   able to convince Parliament that the reward was warranted.
